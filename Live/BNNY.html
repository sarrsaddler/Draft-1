               <h2>COLOR PALETTE</h2>
               <p>My first step in choosing the color palette was identifying what the colors had to represent. The colors had to represent the black network of New York City being apart of a major corporation based in a city filled with immigrants. I also had to understand that the Black experience is different for each member of the group. The colors I used for the group was my attempt to capture the vibrancy of black culture and to remain within the IBM brand. My main source of inspiration came from looking at Caribbean flags, Kwanzaa, and different music genre like Reggae.

    <h2>THE BNNY LOGO</h2>
            <p>The chair of the BNNY board asked for my help on creating a new logo. Immediately I began to think about what this logo should represent because I believe a logo should be functional and able to communicate the organization. In my early attempts of logo design, I wanted to convince the board to move away from the name black network of new york and choose a different name like Melanin. I noticed that Black network of New York ended with three Ks. The three K's was a problem for me because I thought of the  Ku Klux Klan(KKK). The KKK through America history has been a white supremacist organization that oppressed people of color. If the logo was supposed to be effective I thought it should empower people of color to organized.</p>
<p>Due to company restrictions, we couldn't change our name. However, I did come up with a design that stresses the importance of people of color by putting Black in bold characters and on top of everything else. </p>
