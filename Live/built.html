<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Almost every designer I came across had a portfolio that showcases their work history. I was in the minority of designers that didn't have a portfolio. The portfolio is almost essential to gaining new opportunities. I could recall countless conversations where I would tell people that I am a UX design and they replied with something along the lines of amazing, can I see your portfolio? So I decided to make one.</p>

<h3> Problem </h3>
<p>Looking through portfolio template sites like Adobe portfolio, Squarespace and other services I couldn't find a template that resonated with me. </p>

<h3>Solution </h3>
<p>I decided to challenge myself and build my own portfolio. Using my downtime in January 2019 I focused on crafting my portfolio story.</p>

<h3>My process</h3>
<p>Started looking at designers I admire for inspiration and thought about how I could layout my portfolio. When people first enter my site I want them to see an introduction to who I was and what value I bring. Then I wanted to them to see my projects in a card format followed or detailed about me section.</p>

<h3>Wires</h3>
<p>When designing an experience I start off with paper sketches because it helps me get the ideas of faster.  Then when I have an idea I feel that resonates with me and I can clearly explain to someone I bring it to digital low fidelity.</p>

<h2>Color Palette</h2>
<p>The colors I chose for my color palate stem from my personal interest and where I currently reside.
The orange, blue and white resembles New York City's tricolor flag.
The orange and blue combination I also chose it because it resembles the colors of the main protagonist Naruto Uzumaki's attire from the 2002 Japanese anime series Naruto.
I grew up watching the series and still am fond of the storyline.
I frequently use blue in large sections because I find it to be a color that isn't harsh on the eyes. In my design, I decided to use the orange as my call to actions because it is vibrant enough to draw attention.</p>
