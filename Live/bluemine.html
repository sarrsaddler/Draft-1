<h1>Great design is keeping your users in mind.</h1>
   <p> The views below are my own.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In 2017, before IBM's bluemine became one of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/news/item/2019-intranet-design-awards/" target="_blank">2019 Nielson Norman intranet design award winners</a> it existed as a web application that provided analyst, offering managers, and other professionals access to market data. The old bluemine struggled with maintaining a consistent user experience. Users experienced moments where reports and resources link to pages that have been terminated, user interface components were not always consistent.  Bluemine was in need of a total reskin.</p>

<p>My team was created to help build internal consistency in our department's brand. Bluemine was a focal point for the team in charge of design because of traffic and usage the web platform gained over time. Many marketers and professional found the information on bluemine to be useful but the experience terrible.</p>

<p>I joined the design team in August of 2017. I missed some of the work the team did at the beginning of the year like a design audit of the old bluemine but I quickly tried to sync up with team members to figure out where I could be of assistance.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>My efforts targeted bluemine help page redesign. The help page was intended to provide resources to users that experience problems using bluemine.</p>

<h5>Roles</h5>
<p>During this time I wore the hat of Researcher and UI/UX Designer.</p>

<h2>My Process</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>
Syncing up with colleagues helped me discover that earlier in the year, a colleague of mine started to do some exploratory design around the help webpage.  My colleague's design was mostly in low fidelity wireframes that explain the layout of the page.
I thought that my colleague had a good start finding a solution to the help page. I began to do a comparison of what was current on my colleague's wires and of bluemine. Immediately, I noticed the organization of information was different. My colleague used tile layout instead of old bluemine's linking to separate web pages.  I also began to read medium articles, intercom's onboarding material, and other UX material to try to create my own definition of how a help center should function.

<h3>My Definition</h3>
<p>Base on the secondary research and talking to my design team colleagues determine that the help center should be a place that further expands on bluemine user onboarding process. Along with finding resources in regards to using the platform people should be able to be able to confidently search for help items they need.</p>

<h3>Lo-FI</h3>
<p>Base on the information I received I thought it was time for me to develop my own wires and share it with the team. I was inspired by the patterns I saw in my experiences of help pages like Amazon, Spotify, and Apple help page. I later share my wires with the team.</p>

<h3>Mid-Fidelity</h3>
<p>After recieve a few more recommended changes I decided to talk to actual users of bluemine. Before, I could talk to anyone my focus was on developing an interview protocol. The protocol helps focus my discussion and act as a guide through the interviews. I added some color and made my wires clickable using invision. Using an interview protocol I was trying to figure out how people will use this new help center, what they found awkward what they wish they could change.</p>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>
    <p>I find it interesting to hear what users have to say about design. After all the interviews, I loaded the notes into a mural and began identifying commonalities in each interview response.  During the interviews unprompted, the users mention "if you guys had a chatbot here it would great". A chatbot wasn't a feature that came up in my secondary research but I noted that is a possible feature that users expect. Other common theme surfaced from the interview conversation like the wording of some resources sound daunting instead of "explore document" say "Search the help page".</p>

<h3>Delieverable</h3>
My final deliverable to this effort was UX/UI suggestions to the broader bluemine team is responsible for the development and communication. My designs were backed by research conducted and feedback from our users.</p>

<p>It was efforts like that that bluemine awarded this team award.</p>
